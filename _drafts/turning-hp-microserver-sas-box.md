The original HP Microserver G7 was a great and compact server but is now rather dated. I have turned on old one into an external SAS box for my new storage server. SAS boxes are actually quite expensive but are really simple things with a disk cage, power supply and some data cabling.

The G7 Microserver has 4x3.5” SATA disk bays and a spare 5.25” bay at the top of the case which can be fitted either either a DVD / Blueray drive or a 4x2.5” SATA bays.


The parts you need to this are:

* External SAS card e.g. Dell PERC H200E
* 2x SFF-8088 cables
* 2 port SFF-8087 to SFF-8088 card
* SFF-8087 fan out cable for 4x2.5” bay
* Plastic coated paper clip 

the green wire to force the PSU to always turn on
