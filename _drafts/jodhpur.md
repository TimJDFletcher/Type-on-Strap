Jodhpur, the Blue City on the Edge of the Desert

Arriving at Jodhpur Junction at the wonderful time of 6:35 in the morning, from warm and muggy Mumbai the tempuarture was the first thing I noticed it was the first time in India that I acutally felt cold. That was soon forgotten in the rush of arrival at an Indian railway station, dodging porters and avoid men offering taxis and autos.

I had cancelled my hotel in Jodhpur and decided to stay instead at Indrashan homestay, which turned out to be the place I enjoyed staying at most in India. The homestay also offered cooking lessons more on that later.
