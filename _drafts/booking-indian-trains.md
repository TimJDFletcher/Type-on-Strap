Booking Indian trains in person at a specialist tourist booking office is very similar to booking trains in the UK, it's more more interesting to see how the booking works at a normal booking office. I booked most of my tickets in person in Trivandrum, which is part of the Southern Railways section of India.

To book a train in person you need to know a few things about the train you want to travel on:

    The stations you are travelling from and to, it is very helpful to know the short code for the station.
    The train number
    The date you want to travel on (don't bother saying Monday know the date)
    The class you want to travel in, endless reams have already been written about the Indian train class system so I won't revisit them.
