Keeping your root AWS account secure and protected is one of the keys of AWS security, and add an MFA device to the account is part of Amazon's best practices. 

The challenage when working in a team is keeping track of the MFA device and making sure it's available when you need it.

The design my previous team came up with is following:

- Cheap andriod mobile phone, this is basically acting as a TOTP authtication token.
- Print out of the QR code shown on the 

Shared mobile phone or Yubikey
Print out MFA QR code and store in safe
