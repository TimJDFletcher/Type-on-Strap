  Yesterday morning after a 6am! train to Leeds I took and passed my RHCSA exam which combined with my RHCE pass from December means that I am once again officially an RHCE. I have held 3 RHCE certificates originally passing way back in 2000 on <a href="ftp://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/6.1/en/os/i386/README">Red Hat 6.1</a> (no not RHEL 6.1) and again in <a href="https://www.redhat.com/wapps/training/certification/verify.html?certNumber=803005683113619">January 2005</a> on RHEL 3.0.
