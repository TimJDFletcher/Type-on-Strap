Every geek has something like this, a travel kit for when you get asked by people &#8220;oh you know about computers can you email this photo from the top of a Spanish mountain?&#8221;

  * Mobile phone [charging battery](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000UH46YY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000UH46YY&linkCode=as2&tag=atraveltinker-21) (has 2x USB ports, 1 is a 2A port)
  * TP-Link WR703N running OpenWRT with 64MB RAM / 16GB Flash Mod from [slboat](http://stores.ebay.co.uk/SLboat) (Â£25 delivered from China)
  * USB serial port that provides power and a serial console for the WR703R
  * USB 3G stick, unlocked has a PAYG 3 SIM in for UK usage
  * Short Micro USB cable for other gadgets and the wife&#8217;s phone and to charge the battery from a standard USB port
  * Apple Lightning cable for my gadgets, why can&#8217;t you use a standard Apple?
  * Short ethernet cable
  * Bootable 32GB memstick, gives me a few standard Linux options for fixing computers as well as a set of [portable apps](http://portableapps.com/).

The WR703N is setup to run as an AP and access the internet via 3G dial up. Because it&#8217;s got a serial port on it I can tinker to solve lots of different problems without needing network access.

The OpenWRT install on the WR703N also dials into my OpenVPN hosted on this server. It means I can browse as if I am in the UK from anywhere in the world, It&#8217;s amazing how much better hotel wifi is when you can tunnel out of it and run a proper DNS server and web proxy.

The battery will run the AP for 4 days, drops to 2 days with the 3G dongle plugged in and working and gives portable data without having to pay a kidney a megabyte to the mobile carriers. The battery gives a couple of iPhone 5S / Nexus 5 charges and about a 2/3 charge on my iPad mini retina.
