This isn&#8217;t how a positive posts normally starts, but both Serra and I are now unemployed and looking forward to a whole year of not having a job!

We are in the last stages of getting ready to go travelling, we have all our visas and vaccinations, the front room looks like a bomb site and the idea we only have 2 weeks left in the UK has really hit home!

We are about to embark on a tour of the UK to say goodbye to friends and family. We will be in Warwickshire Monday and Tuesday this week, then London next weekend (7-11th of Jan) and finally Plymouth for a few days afterwards. If anyone wants to catch us for a coffee, beer or other beverage drop me a line on social media.

Travel wise we are in India January to March, then China for March and fly to Japan for April. We will be travelling downwards through South East Asia for May and June towards Australia. We are planning to be back in Europe for 4 weeks from mid August before heading off to South America for the rest of the year and the start of 2017. We would love to catch up with friends and family as we travel.
